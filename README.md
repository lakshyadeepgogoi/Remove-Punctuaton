<h1>Text-Editor</h1>




## Introducing 

The main use of this website is when a person which have multiple letters/documents etc, where there are many errors like punctuations, extra line. So, if he/she feels like that it is wrong so he/she want to correct them but unfortunately it is very time-consuming task so in this website it can be done easily where he/she have to copy and paste the lines of sentences then in a few amounts of sec the whole sentences become correct.
There is some more feature where if we want all letters to become in Uppercase it can be done easily, if we want to delete the extra-lines or space it can be done easily.
And also a main thing is that the website give the permission to the user that which setting they want they can use them.✨
